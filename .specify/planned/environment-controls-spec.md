# Project Board Automator - Enhanced Spec

## Project Overview

A GitHub Projects v2 automation tool that synchronizes issues and pull requests across multiple repositories based on configurable rules. The system needs enhancement to be more robust, controllable, and production-ready.

## Current State

The application currently works but has several areas for improvement:
- Basic project board sync functionality exists
- Rules-driven configuration via `rules.yml`
- Modular rule processors (add-items, columns, sprints, assignees)
- State verification and tracking
- Basic batching and rate limiting

## Enhancement Requirements

### 1. Environment-Controlled Operations
- **Existing-items sweep** should be gated behind environment flags
- **Rate-limit checks** should be configurable and enforced
- **DRY_RUN mode** should be available for safe testing

### 2. Event-Driven Processing
- **Restrict processing** to event payload unless sweep is explicitly enabled
- **No-op guards** should prevent unnecessary operations
- **Batching improvements** across all mutators

### 3. Observability and Monitoring
- **Counters and metrics** for all operations
- **End-of-run summaries** with detailed statistics
- **Rate-limit monitoring** and reporting

### 4. Testing and Validation
- **Targeted unit tests** for specific scenarios:
  - Sprint-by-date functionality
  - Pagination handling
  - Assignee delta processing
  - Batch builders

### 5. Production Readiness
- **Error handling** improvements
- **Logging enhancements** with structured output
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets

## Success Criteria

1. **Controllable**: Operations can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
2. **Safe**: DRY_RUN mode prevents accidental changes
3. **Observable**: Clear metrics and reporting on all operations
4. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
5. **Performant**: Efficient processing of large project boards

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing `rules.yml` format
- Must preserve existing API contracts
- Must work with current GitHub Projects v2 API
- Must support existing rule processors without breaking changes
