# Linked Issues Enhancement

## Issue Reference
- **Source**: rules.yml analysis
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Incomplete Implementation

## Problem Statement
The `linked_issues` rules in `rules.yml` define actions like `inherit_column` and `inherit_assignees`, but the current implementation in `src/rules/linked-issues-processor.js` is incomplete. The processor exists but doesn't fully implement the rule-based actions defined in the configuration.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:**
- `linked_issues` rules defined in rules.yml with `inherit_column` and `inherit_assignees` actions
- Basic linked issues processor in `src/rules/linked-issues-processor.js`
- Rule processing framework that can handle linked issues rules

**What's missing:**
- Full implementation of `inherit_column` action
- Full implementation of `inherit_assignees` action
- Integration with rule-based processing system
- Proper handling of linked issue state synchronization

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Inherit Column**: Linked issues should inherit the column from their associated PR
2. **Inherit Assignees**: Linked issues should inherit assignees from their associated PR
3. **Rule-Based Processing**: Use the rule-based system for consistent processing
4. **State Synchronization**: Keep linked issues in sync with PR state changes

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Processing should be efficient for PRs with many linked issues
2. **Reliability**: Linked issue updates should be consistent and error-free
3. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
4. **Integration**: Should work seamlessly with existing rule processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `inherit_column` action works correctly for linked issues
- [ ] `inherit_assignees` action works correctly for linked issues
- [ ] Linked issues are processed using the rule-based system
- [ ] State synchronization works reliably
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for PRs with many linked issues
- [ ] Error handling is robust and informative

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing `src/rules/linked-issues-processor.js`
- Must use the rule-based processing framework
- Must maintain compatibility with existing linked issue functionality
- Must follow existing logging and error handling patterns

## Example Rule from rules.yml
```yaml
linked_issues:
  - name: 'linked_issue_inheritance'
    description: 'Sync linked issues with PR state'
    trigger:
      type: 'LinkedIssue'
      condition: '!item.pr.closed || item.pr.merged'
    action: ['inherit_column', 'inherit_assignees']
    skip_if:
      'item.column === item.pr.column && item.assignees === item.pr.assignees'
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Linked issues inherit column from PR correctly
- [ ] Linked issues inherit assignees from PR correctly
- [ ] Rule-based processing is used consistently
- [ ] State synchronization is reliable
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage exists
