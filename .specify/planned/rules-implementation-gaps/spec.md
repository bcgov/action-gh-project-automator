# Rules Implementation Gaps Analysis

## Issue Reference
- **Source**: Comprehensive rules.yml analysis
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Implementation Audit

## Problem Statement
After analyzing the `rules.yml` configuration against the actual codebase implementation, several rules and features are defined in the configuration but not fully implemented or functional. This creates a gap between what's configured and what actually works.

## Current State Analysis

### **Implemented and Working:**
- ✅ Basic board addition rules (`add_to_board`)
- ✅ Basic column assignment rules (`set_column`)
- ✅ Basic sprint assignment rules (`set_sprint`)
- ✅ Basic assignee rules (`add_assignee`)
- ✅ Rule processing framework
- ✅ Deduplication logic

### **Partially Implemented:**
- ⚠️ Linked issues processing (processor exists but actions incomplete)
- ⚠️ State transition validation (validator exists but not integrated)

### **Missing/Non-Functional:**
- ❌ `validTransitions` validation (defined but not enforced)
- ❌ Sprint removal for inactive columns (Issue #66)
- ❌ `inherit_column` action for linked issues
- ❌ `inherit_assignees` action for linked issues
- ❌ Advanced rule conditions and complex logic
- ❌ Rule-based linked issue processing

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Complete Linked Issues Implementation**: Full support for `inherit_column` and `inherit_assignees` actions
2. **Valid Transitions Enforcement**: Implement and enforce `validTransitions` rules
3. **Sprint Removal Logic**: Add sprint removal for inactive columns (New, Parked, Backlog)
4. **Advanced Rule Conditions**: Support complex conditions and logic in rules
5. **Rule Validation**: Ensure all rules in rules.yml are actually functional

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Completeness**: All rules in rules.yml should be functional
2. **Consistency**: Rule processing should be consistent across all rule types
3. **Performance**: All rules should perform efficiently
4. **Reliability**: Rules should work reliably without errors
5. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All rules defined in rules.yml are functional
- [ ] Linked issues inherit column and assignees correctly
- [ ] Valid transitions are enforced for column changes
- [ ] Sprint removal works for inactive columns
- [ ] Advanced rule conditions are supported
- [ ] Rule processing is consistent across all types
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for all rules
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage exists

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Must integrate with existing rule processing framework
- Must follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Must maintain existing API contracts

## Priority Order for Implementation

### **High Priority (Critical Gaps):**
1. Valid transitions enforcement
2. Sprint removal for inactive columns
3. Complete linked issues implementation

### **Medium Priority (Enhancement Gaps):**
4. Advanced rule conditions
5. Rule validation and testing
6. Performance optimization

### **Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
7. Additional rule types
8. Advanced rule logic
9. Rule debugging tools

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of rules in rules.yml are functional
- [ ] All rule types work consistently
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Clear documentation for all rules
