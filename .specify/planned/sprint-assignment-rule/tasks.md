# Sprint Assignment Rule - Actionable Tasks

## Task 1: Update Rules Configuration
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Subtasks:
1.1. Add new sprint removal rule to `rules.yml`

1.3. Verify rule appears in configuration loader

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] New rule added to rules.yml
- [ ] Rule syntax is valid YAML
- [ ] Configuration loader can parse the rule
- [ ] Rule follows existing naming conventions

## Task 2: Implement Remove Sprint Action
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

### Subtasks:
2.1. Add `remove_sprint` action handler to `src/rules/sprints.js`
2.2. Implement no-op guard for null sprint values
2.3. Add logging for sprint removal operations
2.4. Ensure proper error handling

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `remove_sprint` action is implemented
- [ ] No-op guard prevents API calls when sprint is null
- [ ] Logging shows sprint removal operations
- [ ] Error handling is robust

## Task 3: Update Rule Processor
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Subtasks:
3.1. Ensure new rule is processed in correct order
3.2. Add validation for remove_sprint action
3.3. Test rule integration with existing logic

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Rule processes after existing sprint rules
- [ ] Action validation works correctly
- [ ] Integration with existing logic is seamless

## Task 4: Create Unit Tests
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours

### Subtasks:
4.1. Test sprint removal for New column
4.2. Test sprint removal for Parked column
4.3. Test sprint removal for Backlog column
4.4. Test no-op guard behavior
4.5. Test rule integration scenarios

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All three target columns are tested
- [ ] No-op guard behavior is verified
- [ ] Rule integration tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive

## Task 5: Integration Testing
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

### Subtasks:
5.1. Test with real project data
5.2. Verify API call reduction with no-op guards
5.3. Test rule behavior with existing sprint rules
5.4. Validate end-to-end functionality

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Real project data tests pass
- [ ] API call reduction is measurable
- [ ] Existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] End-to-end tests are successful

## Task 6: Documentation Update
**Priority**: Low
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Subtasks:
