# Valid Transitions Implementation

## Issue Reference
- **Source**: rules.yml analysis
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Missing Feature

## Problem Statement
The `rules.yml` configuration defines `validTransitions` for column rules, but these transitions are not being validated or enforced. This means the system could potentially make invalid state transitions that don't align with project management workflows.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:**
- `validTransitions` defined in rules.yml for column rules
- Basic column assignment logic in `src/rules/columns.js`
- State transition validator exists but not integrated

**What's missing:**
- Validation of transitions before executing column changes
- Enforcement of valid transition rules
- Integration with existing column assignment logic

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Transition Validation**: Validate column transitions against `validTransitions` rules before execution
2. **Rule Enforcement**: Block invalid transitions and log appropriate warnings
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing column assignment logic
4. **Logging**: Clear logging when transitions are blocked or allowed

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Validation should not significantly impact processing speed
2. **Reliability**: Validation should be consistent and deterministic
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new transition rules
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing rules without `validTransitions` should continue working

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Column transitions are validated against `validTransitions` rules
- [ ] Invalid transitions are blocked with appropriate logging
- [ ] Valid transitions proceed normally
- [ ] Rules without `validTransitions` work as before (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 10ms per validation)
- [ ] Clear error messages for blocked transitions

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing `src/rules/columns.js` module
- Must work with existing state verification systems
- Must maintain backward compatibility with rules without `validTransitions`
- Must follow existing logging and error handling patterns

## Example Valid Transitions from rules.yml
```yaml
validTransitions:
  - from: 'New'
    to: 'Active'
    conditions: []
  - from: 'None'
    to: 'Active'
    conditions: []
  - from: 'None'
    to: 'New'
    conditions: []
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All defined `validTransitions` are enforced
- [ ] Invalid transitions are blocked with clear logging
- [ ] No performance degradation in column processing
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for transition validation
