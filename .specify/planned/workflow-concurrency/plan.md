# Workflow Concurrency - Technical Plan

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis
1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Analyze existing workflow concurrency settings
   - Document current behavior and potential issues
   - Identify race condition scenarios
   - Measure current performance and resource usage

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate race condition risks
   - Assess duplicate processing impact
   - Analyze API rate limit consumption
   - Review logging and debugging challenges

### Phase 2: Solution Design
1. **Option Evaluation**
   - Compare strict concurrency vs. current setup vs. hybrid
   - Evaluate trade-offs for each option
   - Consider performance, safety, and maintainability
   - Document recommendation with justification

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Design chosen solution architecture
   - Plan integration with existing workflow
   - Define monitoring and observability requirements
   - Create testing strategy

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Workflow Updates**
   - Implement chosen concurrency solution
   - Update GitHub Actions workflow configuration
   - Add monitoring and logging
   - Implement safety guards

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test concurrency scenarios
   - Verify race condition prevention
   - Validate performance impact
   - Test error handling and recovery

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Investigation Approach
- **Decision**: Start with current state analysis and risk assessment
- **Rationale**: Need to understand the problem before solving it

### 2. Solution Selection Criteria
- **Decision**: Evaluate based on safety, performance, and maintainability
- **Rationale**: All three factors are critical for production system

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement incrementally with monitoring
- **Rationale**: Allows validation of solution before full deployment

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze current workflow concurrency behavior**
2. **Document risks and potential issues**
3. **Evaluate solution options**
4. **Choose and justify solution**
5. **Implement chosen solution**
6. **Add monitoring and observability**
7. **Test and validate solution**
8. **Document final implementation**

## Risk Mitigation

- **Investigation First**: Understand the problem before implementing solution
- **Incremental Implementation**: Test solution before full deployment
- **Monitoring**: Add observability to detect issues early
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to current setup if needed
