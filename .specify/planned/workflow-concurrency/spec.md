# Workflow Concurrency Investigation & Implementation

## Issue Reference
- **GitHub Issue**: #77
- **Title**: Investigate: Allow concurrent workflow runs or enforce strict concurrency?
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Investigation + Implementation

## Problem Statement
The current workflow can run multiple times simultaneously (PRs + scheduled runs), which may cause race conditions, duplicate API calls, and state inconsistency. We need to investigate the risks and implement a solution.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:**
- Workflow can run multiple times simultaneously
- Concurrency group is set to PR-specific isolation
- No dry run mode implemented
- PR isolation + scheduled run deduplication

**Potential Issues:**
- Race conditions between runs
- Duplicate processing of items
- API rate limit consumption
- Log confusion and debugging difficulty
- Resource waste (CPU/memory)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Investigation**: Analyze current concurrency behavior and risks
2. **Solution Design**: Choose between strict concurrency, current setup, or hybrid approach
3. **Implementation**: Implement chosen solution
4. **Monitoring**: Add observability for concurrency issues
5. **Testing**: Verify solution works correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Safety**: Prevent race conditions and duplicate processing
2. **Performance**: Minimize resource waste and API rate limit consumption
3. **Reliability**: Ensure consistent state and predictable behavior
4. **Observability**: Clear logging and monitoring of concurrency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current concurrency behavior is fully analyzed
- [ ] Risks and trade-offs are documented
- [ ] Solution is chosen and justified
- [ ] Implementation prevents race conditions
- [ ] Duplicate processing is eliminated
- [ ] API rate limits are respected
- [ ] Logging is clear and debuggable
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must integrate with existing logging and monitoring
- Must follow GitHub Actions best practices

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Strict Concurrency
- **Pros**: No race conditions, predictable behavior
- **Cons**: Slower processing, potential bottlenecks
- **Implementation**: Single concurrency group across all triggers

### Option 2: Current Setup (PR Isolation)
- **Pros**: Faster processing, PR-specific isolation
- **Cons**: Potential race conditions, duplicate processing
- **Implementation**: Keep current PR isolation + scheduled deduplication

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Pros**: Balanced approach, different groups for different triggers
- **Cons**: More complex, harder to debug
- **Implementation**: Different concurrency groups for different trigger types

## Success Metrics
- [ ] No race conditions observed
- [ ] No duplicate processing
- [ ] API rate limits respected
- [ ] Clear logging and debugging
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Solution is maintainable
