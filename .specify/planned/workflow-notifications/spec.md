# Workflow Notifications System

## Issue Reference
- **GitHub Issue**: #63
- **Title**: feat: workflow notifications to Slack/Teams/email
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Feature Implementation

## Problem Statement
The current workflow provides no notifications for key events, errors, or summaries. Users have no visibility into workflow execution, failures, or important changes without manually checking logs or GitHub Actions.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:**
- Basic logging to console/logs
- GitHub Actions workflow execution
- No external notifications
- No summary reporting

**What's missing:**
- Notifications for key events (success, failure, errors)
- Summary reports (what was processed, what changed)
- Pluggable notification transports (Slack, Teams, email)
- Rate-limited notifications to prevent spam
- Opt-in configuration for different notification types

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Event Notifications**: Notify on workflow start, completion, errors
2. **Summary Reports**: Send summaries of what was processed and changed
3. **Pluggable Transports**: Support Slack, Teams, email, and extensible for others
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent notification spam with intelligent rate limiting
5. **Opt-in Configuration**: Allow users to configure which notifications to receive
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of notification failures

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Notifications should not impact workflow performance
2. **Reliability**: Notification failures should not break workflow execution
3. **Security**: Secure handling of notification credentials and tokens
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new notification transports
5. **Configurability**: Flexible configuration for different environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Notifications sent for workflow start, completion, and errors
- [ ] Summary reports include processing statistics and changes
- [ ] Slack integration works with webhook or bot
- [ ] Teams integration works with webhook
- [ ] Email integration works with SMTP
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents notification spam
- [ ] Opt-in configuration allows selective notifications
- [ ] Notification failures don't break workflow execution
- [ ] New transports can be easily added
- [ ] Configuration is secure and flexible

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Must not impact workflow performance significantly
- Must handle notification failures gracefully
- Must follow security best practices for credentials
- Must be configurable via environment variables

## Notification Types

### **Event Notifications:**
- Workflow started
- Workflow completed (success/failure)
- Critical errors
- Rate limit warnings

### **Summary Reports:**
- Items processed count
- Changes made (items added, columns changed, etc.)
- Errors encountered
- Performance metrics

### **Transport Options:**
- **Slack**: Webhook or bot integration
- **Teams**: Webhook integration
- **Email**: SMTP integration
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for other transports

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Notifications are sent reliably for key events
- [ ] Summary reports provide useful information
- [ ] Multiple transport options are available
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents spam
- [ ] Configuration is flexible and secure
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] System is maintainable and extensible
