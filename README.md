**Project Sync** is a high-performance GitHub Projects v2 automation engine designed to synchronize issues and pull requests across complex, multi-repository organizations with 100% predictability.

## Overview

This tool transforms your GitHub Project into a self-driving productivity engine. It eliminates manual board maintenance by implementing a rule-based state machine for:

- **Intelligent Intake**: Automatically adds PRs and issues to the project board based on authorship, assignment, or repository source.
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Moves items between columns (e.g., `New` → `Active`) based on real-time state changes.
- **Sprint Orchestration**: Seamlessly manages sprint assignments and rollovers.
- **Smart Inheritance**: Propagates PR metadata (assignees, sprints, columns) to linked issues.
- **Multi-Org Mastery**: Monitors activity across `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` simultaneously.

## Usage as a GitHub Action

You can consume Project Automator directly in your workflow without checking out the repository:

```yaml
name: Project Sync

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # Hourly
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions: {}

jobs:
  sync:
    name: Sync Board
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Project Automator
        uses: bcgov/project-automator@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_SYNC_TOKEN }}
          config_path: rules.yml
          dry_run: false
```

### Action Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `github_token` | **Yes** | — | Personal access token that can read and write the project board and read the monitored repositories. See [Authentication & Token Setup](#authentication--token-setup). |
| `config_path` | No | `rules.yml` | Path to rules configuration file in the repository. |
| `dry_run` | No | `false` | Run in read-only mode without mutating board items or watermarks. |
| `backfill` | No | `''` | Backfill window for open items: `30d`-style or `all`. |
| `verbose` | No | `true` | Enable verbose log output. |

## Automated Noise Exclusions

To prevent automated noise and metadata artifacts from cluttering the project board, the engine early-skips issues and pull requests matching specific titles or labels before applying rule transitions.

### Default Exclusions
By default, the engine excludes:
- **Dependency Dashboard** (Exact Match): Excludes Renovate or Dependabot organization-wide interactive dashboards.
- **ZAP Security Report** (Substring Match): Excludes automated vulnerability and security scan reports.
- **ZAP Full Scan Report**, **ZAP Scan Baseline Report**, **ZAP API Scan Report** (Substring Match): Exclude issues opened by the ZAP GitHub Actions (`zaproxy/action-full-scan`, `action-baseline`, `action-api-scan`) under their default titles, and titles that extend them (e.g. `ZAP Full Scan Report: <url>` from `bcgov/actions/scan-url`).
- **ZAP: ** (Prefix Match): Excludes ZAP reports opened with a custom `issue_title` such as `ZAP: <name>` (e.g. `ZAP: backendPy` from `bcgov/quickstart-openshift-modules`).

### Custom Exclusions
Teams can customize exclusions in their `rules.yml` to filter out specific automated noise:

```yaml
# Exclusion rules to filter out automated noise by title
exclusions:
  exact_titles:
    - "Dependency Dashboard"
    - "My Custom Noise Title"
  title_substrings:
    - "ZAP Security Report"
    - "ZAP Full Scan Report"
    - "ZAP Scan Baseline Report"
    - "ZAP API Scan Report"
    - "[Automated]"
  title_prefixes:
    - "ZAP: "
  exclude_labels:
    - "do not track"
```

Strings checked against `exact_titles` must match the issue or pull request title exactly (trailing/leading whitespaces and carriage returns are automatically trimmed before evaluation). Strings in `title_substrings` will exclude any item containing that substring, and strings in `title_prefixes` will exclude any item whose title starts with that prefix. Title matches are case-sensitive. An item carrying any label in `exclude_labels` is skipped; label names must match whole, ignoring case, as GitHub treats label names. The three title lists are required in `rules.yml`; there are no built-in defaults. `exclude_labels` is the one optional key: when it's absent, no labels are excluded (`[]`), so configs written before it keep working. Like title exclusions, a label exclusion skips the item on every run, so it isn't added, moved or assigned; it isn't removed from the board if it's already there.

## Stability & Predictability

We treat stability as a first-class feature. Our "Ludicrous Testing" philosophy ensures that every rule processed is verified against a comprehensive matrix of conditions.

- **Hardcoded Validation**: We use a strict whitelist-based validator to ensure rule evaluation is 100% predictable and secure against code injection.
- **Native Efficiency**: Built on **Node.js 24** and native **ES Modules** for lightning-fast, future-proof execution.
- **Zero-Network Tests**: Our 240+ count test suite runs in pure isolation, guaranteeing that the core logic is bulletproof without ever making a real API call.
- **Strict Environments**: We enforce Node versions via `.npmrc` to ensure that every developer and CI runner is perfectly aligned.

## Visibility & Auditing

Designed for transparency. Every run provides:

- **GitHub Actions Job Summary**: A premium Markdown report generated in the Action's summary tab.
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed console output with a `[AUDIT]` prefix for all state transitions.
- **Precision Metrics**: Real-time counters for processed, added, and skipped items.

## Configuration

Configure your entire workflow in a single, version-controlled `rules.yml` file.

### Project Connection
The tool resolves your project identity with minimal friction:

```yaml
project:
  url: https://github.com/orgs/bcgov/projects/16
  # Organization and ID are automatically resolved from the URL
```

### Resource Monitoring
Define which realms the engine should govern:

```yaml
project:
  allowedOrgs:
    - bcgov
    - bcgov-c
```

### Authentication & Token Setup

The sync engine requires authentication via a repository secret named `PROJECT_SYNC_TOKEN` configured in your workflow (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`).

#### Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (recommended)

1. Go to GitHub **Settings** → **Developer Settings** → **Personal Access Tokens** → [**Fine-grained tokens**](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new). A token owned by a team or service account is better than a personal one.
2. Set **Token name** to `PROJECT_SYNC_TOKEN`.
3. Set **Resource owner** to the organization that owns the project board.
4. Under **Repository access**, choose **All repositories** if `user_scope` is set: user searches aren't limited to the monitored list, and the token also needs the issues a PR closes and, without a checkout, the repository holding `rules.yml`. Otherwise you can select the monitored repositories plus those.
5. Set these permissions:
   * **Organization → Projects: Read and write**, for the project board.
   * **Repository → Issues: Read** and **Pull requests: Read**, for search and item metadata. Choose **Read and write** for both if `user_scope` is set, because the run assigns authored items to their author.
   * **Repository → Contents: Read**, only when `rules.yml` is fetched without a checkout.
   * **Repository → Metadata: Read** is included automatically.

No organization membership permission (classic `read:org`) is needed.

A fine-grained token reaches only one owner (one organization or user), so a config spanning several organizations or users needs a classic PAT for now; per-owner tokens are planned. Give the classic PAT the `project` and `repo` scopes (`public_repo` is enough when every monitored repository is public).

Adding an assignee requires admin rights on that repository. When GitHub responds `Must have admin rights to Repository`, the engine logs a warning, leaves the GitHub assignee unchanged, and continues. The item is still added to the project, and its status and sprint are still updated.

#### Access Failures

A run fails, with a non-zero exit and a message naming what to fix, when:

- The token can't read the project board.
- The token can't read a repository in `automation.repository_scope.repositories`. This is checked before any search, because GitHub search skips a repository it can't read without an error.
- A search fails. The watermark isn't saved, so the next run searches the same window again.
- The token is empty in an Actions run, including `dry_run: true`. From the command line, `--dry-run` and `--validate` without a token still check `rules.yml` offline.

#### Adding the Secret to GitHub Actions

1. Copy the generated token string.
2. Navigate to your repository's **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Set **Name** to `PROJECT_SYNC_TOKEN` and paste your token in **Secret**.

## Development

- **Design notes**: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) explains how the sync discovers items and decides board changes.
- **Project Constitution**: Review [memory/constitution.md](memory/constitution.md) for our core development principles.
- **AI Pair Programming**: See [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for guidance when working with AI coding assistants.

## Search Window & API Usage

Each run searches open issues and PRs, plus PRs closed without merging, updated since the last successful run (the watermark, minus a 10-minute overlap). Without a watermark it falls back to the last 2 hours. Closed and merged items are left to GitHub's built-in project workflows, which move them to Done. Board membership, Status and Sprint come back with the search results, so there are no per-item board lookups, and the monitored repos are combined into as few searches as fit. Each run's job summary shows the API call count and the remaining rate limit.

## Catch Up

Normal runs only see items updated since the last successful run. To add older open items that aren't on the board yet (for example after adding repos to `repository_scope`), go to **Actions → Sync → Run workflow**, tick **Catch up**, and run it. From the command line:

```bash
gh workflow run sync.yml -R bcgov/project-automator -f catch_up=true
```

A catch-up runs the normal sync code with the backfill set to `all`. It searches all open issues and PRs in the monitored repos (and the monitored users' authored, assigned and review-requested items), ignoring the watermark, and applies the same exclusions. It only adds the missing items, in the `board_columns.issue.no_status` column (New). Items already on the board aren't re-added or moved, and the run doesn't save the watermark. Leave it unticked for a normal run. There's no schedule for it.

## Testing

We value exhaustive verification. Run the full suite, including the ludicrous coverage matrix:

```bash
npm test
```

For targeted testing of the core engines:
```bash
# Test the unified rule processor
npm test -- test/processors/unified-rule-processor.test.js

# Test the ludicrous validation matrix
npm test -- test/processors/ludicrous-coverage.test.js
```
